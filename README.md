"While there is not a way to "convert" citations in a Mendeley document, It is possible to use the existing document with Mendeley citations. This would  be done by creating a Mendeley style which mimics EndNote's temporary citations. Once the style is created, the user would save a copy of their existing document, then format it using the new style.
Then they would remove the Mendeley field codes (this is an option offered in their "Export" option within Word). This new document can now be used by EndNote's CWYW."
